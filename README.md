Solutions for Google Code Jam
=============================

Some of the solutions will be posted in this repo.

They might differ from ones that I have posted during the contest.
The reason is that contest code usually being written in haste and may contain some marks/comments/copy-paste.
But I like to see the clean and reasonable code in the end.
Main logic stays the same, of course.

Only the working solutions will be posted here.
If some of them were completed after finishing the contest, this will be marked in comments.

Input files to do some checks/experiments with the code may be freely downloaded from [Google Code Jam](http://code.google.com/codejam>) site.
